# Libraries

Collection of libraries for use with x86 / x64 assembler

Some of the libraries have been created by myself, the rest are by others and other projects, and in those cases I have only compiled static versions (if possible) and converted .h header files to assembler style .inc files for ease of use with x86 and x64 assemblers: masm, jwasm, hjwasm, uasm etc

The libraries that I have created (some of them) have documentation on the functions they contain. More information can be found in the [wiki](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/wiki)

Some releases have been packaged for convenience and can be found [here](https://github.com/mrfearless/libraries/releases)

Hopefully you find them useful in your coding.
