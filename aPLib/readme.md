> aPLib is a compression library based on the algorithm used in aPACK (my  executable compressor). aPLib is an easy-to-use alternative to many of the heavy-weight compression libraries available.

> The compression ratios achieved by aPLib combined with the speed and tiny footprint of the depackers (as low as 169 bytes!) makes it the ideal choice
> for many products.

> Since the first public release in 1998, aPLib has been one of the top pure LZ-based compression libraries available. It is used in a wide range of products including executable compression and protection software, archivers, games, embedded systems, and handheld devices.
