# FSE 0.9.0

FSE (Finite State Entropy) static libraries compiled for x86 and x64 assembler 

FSE: https://github.com/Cyan4973/FiniteStateEntropy

> New generation entropy codecs : Finite State Entropy and Huff0

> This library proposes two high speed entropy coders :

> Huff0, a Huffman codec designed for modern CPU, featuring OoO (Out of Order) operations on multiple ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit), achieving extremely fast compression and decompression speeds.

> FSE is a new kind of Entropy encoder, based on ANS theory, from Jarek Duda, achieving precise compression accuracy (like Arithmetic coding) at much higher speeds.
